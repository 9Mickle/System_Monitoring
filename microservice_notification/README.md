# Microservice 2 - notification application

## Task descriptions:
Provides sending notifications. 
The notification can be sent to the mentor by different channels (email, sms)
Accordingly, the interface and its implementation should be added.
The interface must contain a single method - notify

In the context of the task, the actual message will not be sent.
Instead, you need to add an implementation that simply writes a message to the log.
